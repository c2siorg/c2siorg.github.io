  <dt>Brief explanation</dt>
  <dd>FactBounty is a crowdsourced fact-checking platform designed to enhance the security, privacy, and trustworthiness of social media ecosystems. With the rise of misinformation, FactBounty leverages the power of intelligent crowds and AI-driven analytics to verify the authenticity of content. The platform features an intuitive user interface, real-time analytics, and seamless integration with various social media channels.
<br /><br />
This project focuses on optimizing fact-checking workflows by incorporating AI-powered fake news detection, a refined UI/UX, and scalable backend architecture. FactBounty serves as a centralized solution for fact verification, ensuring a reliable and transparent digital experience.

  <dt>Key Objectives</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li><em>UI/UX Design:</em> Create the app’s user interface and experience by following proper design principles.</li>
      <li><em>AI-Powered Analytics:</em> Integrate NLP-based analytics to detect and classify fake news efficiently.</li>
      <li><em>React Native Implementation:</em> Expand the platform by developing a React Native app for cross-platform accessibility.</li>
      <li><em>Backend Migration:</em> Transition the backend to Go (using Gin or Echo) for improved performance, scalability, and maintainability. Use Go-based async routes. Go provides built-in Swagger support for API documentation.</li>
      <li><em>CI/CD Integration:</em> Automate testing and deployment using GitHub Actions with docker-conternarizations to ensure seamless updates.
<br /><br /></li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>Expected Results</dt>
  <dd>By the completion of this project, FactBounty will achieve:
    <ul>
      <li>Overall migration to more efficient frameworks and dependencies in Flask and Elasticsearch.</li>
      <li>AI-Driven Fact Checking: Improved misinformation detection through NLP-based analytics,semantic similarity matching for detecting duplicate fact-checks.</li>
      <li>Scalable and Efficient Backend: A Go-based backend for enhanced speed and reliability.</li>
      <li>Cross-Platform Accessibility: A React Native app ensuring a seamless mobile experience.</li>
      <li>Automated CI/CD Pipelines: Fully integrated build, test, and deployment workflows with Github actions.</li>
      <li>Modernize the Frontend: Upgrade React dependencies and remove unnecessary Chrome-only restrictions,consider replacing Redux Devtools dependency if not required.
<br /><br /></li>
    </ul>
