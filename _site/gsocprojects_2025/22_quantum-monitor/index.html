  <dt>Brief explanation</dt>
  <dd>QuantumMonitor will be a real-time monitoring tool specifically designed to track the performance and health of quantum hardware. It will collect and visualize critical metrics, including qubit health, noise levels, temperature, and error rates. The tool will provide a comprehensive dashboard that offers insights into quantum processor stability, enabling researchers and engineers to monitor quantum devices more effectively and ensure that they are operating optimally.
