  <dt>Brief explanation</dt>
  <dd>The goal of this project is to develop a QEMU plugin that dynamically instruments userspace binaries as they execute. Leveraging QEMU’s plugin infrastructure, the tool will provide comprehensive instrumentation capabilities including instruction tracing, memory access logging, and control-flow analysis without requiring modifications to the original binaries. The project will result in an open-source tool that can be used for performance profiling, debugging, and security analysis.
<br /><br /></dd>
  <dt>Expected Results</dt>
  <dd>The tool will be evaluated using a bunch of packed and obstructed binaries.

  <dt>Key Objectives</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Dynamic Instrumentation:</em> Develop a plugin that intercepts key runtime events (e.g., instruction execution, memory accesses, system calls) in user-mode binaries using QEMU’s plugin API.</li>
      <li><em>Performance Profiling:</em> Collect and report metrics such as instruction counts, basic block execution frequencies, cache behavior, and memory access patterns to help analyze performance bottlenecks.</li>
      <li><em>Modular and Extensible Design:</em> Architect the plugin so that additional instrumentation features (such as logging, event correlation, and statistical analysis) can be added with minimal changes.
<br /><br /></li>
    </ul>
