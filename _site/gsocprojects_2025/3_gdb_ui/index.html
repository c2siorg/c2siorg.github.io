  <dt>Brief explanation</dt>
  <dd>GDB-UI is a modern, web-based interface for the GNU Debugger (GDB), designed to simplify the debugging process for developers working with C, and C++. It provides real-time interaction with GDB, enabling features like monitoring program execution, inspecting variables, setting breakpoints, and more, all through an intuitive web application.
<br /><br />
GDB-UI enhances the debugging workflow by offering a sleek, user-friendly UI, replacing the traditional command-line experience with a visual and accessible alternative. It supports both Docker-based and manual setups, allowing seamless integration into various development environments.
