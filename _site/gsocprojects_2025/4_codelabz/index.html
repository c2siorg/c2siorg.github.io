  <dt>Brief Explanation</dt>
  <dd>CodeLabz is an interactive, cloud-based learning platform designed to facilitate engagement with online tutorials. It enables organizations to create, manage, and share structured learning resources with users. The platform is built with a ReactJS frontend, complemented by a scalable backend powered by Google Cloud Firestore and Firebase Realtime Database, ensuring seamless real-time data synchronization and an intuitive user experience.
<br /><br />
This project focuses on optimizing learning workflows by integrating an enhanced UI, efficient data management, and dynamic real-time updates. CodeLabz serves as a centralized solution for tutorial creation, consumption, and collaboration, ensuring an effective and scalable educational experience. It currently requires the following improvements.

  <dt><strong>Key Objectives</strong></dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>

<ol>
  <li><em>Backend and Deployment:</em>
    <ul>
      <li>The app is temporarily deployed on the client side using Firebase Hosting, so we need a no-cost solution for serverless deployment.</li>
      <li>Find a free serverless hosting solution and migrate APIs from Firebase Functions while ensuring scalability, reliability, and minimal maintenance.
<br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Implement Real-Time Notification System (No Cost):</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Research and implement a real-time notification system integrated with in-app notifications.</li>
      <li>Ensure functionality for push and in-app notifications within free-tier limits.
<br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Managing Org-Setting (Including Roles) and Implement Admin Features:</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop functionalities for managing organization settings.</li>
      <li>Implement role-based access control to ensure secure and controlled access.</li>
      <li>Enhance the admin dashboard with real-time API refresh and analytics.
<br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Optimize NoSQL Queries for Performance:</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify key indexes, optimize slow queries, and implement caching or denormalization strategies to improve retrieval times.
<br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Containerization &amp; Dockerization:</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Implement Docker for consistent development and production environments..
<br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>UI/UX Refinement:</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Improve design consistency, usability, and responsiveness across all devices with proper design principles.</li>
      <li>The codebase contains partial migrations and multiple MUI versions, so make it consistent and update it to the latest versions.
<br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Ensure Proper Migration and Consistency:</em>
    <ul>
      <li>The codebase includes deprecated npm libraries and modules, update or replace them.</li>
      <li>Convert the existing JavaScript codebase to TypeScript, ensuring type safety and maintainability.
<br /><br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
