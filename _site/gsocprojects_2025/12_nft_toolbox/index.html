  <dt>Brief explanation</dt>
  <dd>An npm package for seamless integration of all NFT related functionalities in Web2 projects. This project helps web2 developers seamlessly integrate web3 functionality.
<br /><br /></dd>
  <dt>Expected Results</dt>
  <dd>Currently we are able to mint NFT on Ethereum chain and upload metadata to multiple storage services. The current task is to improve the existing stuff with multi-chain support like Solana, Tezos and EVM compatible chains, add more ERC’s support, make different types of on-chain and off-chain algorithms for super fast batch minting of NFT and add support for Soulbound NFTs, dynamic NFT and nested NFT. A website with all these functionalities needs to be created along with required smart contracts.
<br /><br />
Features we would like to implement in NFT-ToolBox Project:
<br /><br />
    <ul>
      <li>You need to refactor code</li>
      <li>Add onchain and offchain Batch Minting Support</li>
      <li>Add Multiple ERC support related to nfts in easy and feasible manner</li>
      <li>Add support for Solana NFT’s</li>
      <li>Add Support for Tezos NFT’s</li>
      <li>Add support for Flow Blockchian NFT’s</li>
      <li>Add support for Aptos Blockchian NFT’s</li>
      <li>Add Support for Cross Chain NFT’s</li>
      <li>Build An UI to mint NFT’s on any chain</li>
      <li>Make UI to deploy different kinds of NFT standards (Something like Thirdweb)
<br /><br />
Note: You don’t need to implement all these features this year. You have to come up with proposal of what things can be implemented in the GSoC timeline and How.
