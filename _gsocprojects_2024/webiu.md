---
Brief explanation
: The proposed project aims to create a dynamic organization website that automatically fetches project information from GitHub repositories. This eliminates the need for manual data entry, ensuring real-time updates on the organization's website whenever a new repository is created or existing is updated. The website will also feature a configurable project template that provides essential details such as project title, description, technology stack, live demo availability, and more.
<br><br>
-- Admin Controls: Create an admin control panel to manage the display of projects on the website. This includes the ability to show/hide specific projects and modify their display settings.
<br><br>
-- Backend Integration: Choose a backend solution (e.g., AWS, MongoDB) to store and manage additional data, such as admin configurations and website settings.
<br><br>
-- Documentation: Improve and maintain documentation related to the development areas, ensuring clarity for future contributors.
<br><br>

Expected Results
: By the end of the project, the dynamic organization website should seamlessly integrate with GitHub repositories, displaying accurate and up-to-date information. The website's configurable project template will allow administrators to control which projects are showcased on the site, providing flexibility and customization options
<br><br>

Knowledge Prerequisites
: Proficiency in Angular, TypeScript, and JavaScript is essential for this project. Familiarity with backend technologies like AWS or MongoDB is beneficial. Additionally, understanding GitHub API and web development concepts will be advantageous.
