title: ProjectExplainer - Add knowledge graph based retrieval and explanation APIs for code and text modalities in documentation.
---
Brief explanation
: ProjectExplainer project is a set of tools to help with explaining code repositories using large language models.
<br><br>
At this point, ProjectExplainer supports a small set of API’s to provide summarization or explanation capabilities over GitHub based code repositories by parsing through readme’s and pulling important pieces of information which is then provided as prompt to an LLM to produce summarization.
<br><br>
With this GSoC project, we wish to include knowledge graphs to embed GitHub repository code and text  modalities to use that as a retrieval interface for the LLM to perform summarization/explanation task.
<br><br>

Expected Results
: At the end of the GSoC term, we expect integration of knowledge graphs for both text and code modalities and expose another set of API’s for summarization or explanation tasks.
