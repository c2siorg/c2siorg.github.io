Brief explanation 
: The objective of this project is to develop a public dataset derived from openly available Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) information. The primary goal is to create a set of fully functional scrapers designed to collect CVE data from various sources, augment this data with comprehensive data points, and make it publicly available.
Data sources and data structures will be announced in due course.
<br><br>

Knowledge Prerequisites
: -- Basic understanding of cybersecurity concepts, especially related to vulnerabilities and exposures.
: -- Proficiency in programming languages used for web scraping (e.g., Python).
: -- Familiarity with data manipulation and storage techniques.
: -- Knowledge of web technologies and protocols.
<br><br>

Expected Results
: -- Development of a reliable and efficient web scraping framework capable of collecting CVE data from specified sources.
: -- A comprehensive dataset that includes detailed information on vulnerabilities, such as descriptions, severity ratings, impacted systems, and mitigation measures.
: -- Regular updates to the dataset as new CVE information becomes available.
: -- Documentation on the data collection process, data structure, and usage guidelines for the dataset.
