Brief explanation 
: In this project, our objective is to develop a CyberSecurity News API tailored for automated bots on social media platforms. It is a cutting-edge Flask-based API that grants seamless access to the latest cybersecurity and hacker news. Users can effortlessly retrieve news articles either through specific keywords or without, streamlining the information acquisition process.
<br><br>
Once a user requests our API, it retrieves news data from our knowledge base and feeds it to an LLM. After the LLM processes the data, the API obtains the response and returns it in JSON format..
<br><br>

Expected results
: At the end of the GSoC term, we expect integration of an LLM to the B0Bot.
