title: ImageLab

Brief explanation
: ImageLab is a standalone tool that supports anyone to get started with image processing-related concepts and techniques in an interactive, less logical way. So, this tool enables and also motivates fresh users to understand how image processing concepts work by interacting with ImageLab. The upcoming enhancements for ImageLab in this year's Google Summer of Code aim to significantly augment its user experience and broaden its applicability across various use cases.
<br><br>

Expected results
: Our goal is to transform ImageLab into a more versatile and user-engaging platform. The enhancements are targeted towards facilitating real-world applications and improving user interaction.
<br>
: -- Integrate real-time video processing capability.
: -- Transition the application's architecture from an experiment-centric to a project-based approach.
: -- Develop a project library for easy management and retrieval of user projects.
: -- Implement user profile functionality for personalized experiences
: -- Allow users to save their work on the cloud for easy access and collaboration.
: -- Implement features to collect user analytics and feedback within the application.
: -- To make ImageLab globally accessible, add support for multiple languages in the user interface.
: -- Incorporate interactive tutorials, guides, and educational content within the tool to help users learn image processing concepts as they use ImageLab.
