title: TensorMap
---

Brief explanation 
: TensorMap is a web application that will allow the users to create machine learning algorithms visually. TensorMap supports reverse engineering of the visual layout to a Tensorflow implementation in preferred languages. The goal of the project is to let the beginners play with machine learning algorithms in Tensorflow without less background knowledge about the library.

Expected Results
: 
 * Clean up the project structure.
 * Completely switch to poetry for dependency management.
 * Complete the project Wiki.
 * Implement additional visualizations such as 3D plots, heatmaps, and interactive graphs.
 * Add built-in functions for common data augmentation techniques.
 * Add more functionality to the application (open-ended).
