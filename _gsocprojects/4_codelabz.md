Brief Explanation
: CodeLabz is an interactive, cloud-based learning platform designed to facilitate engagement with online tutorials. It enables organizations to create, manage, and share structured learning resources with users. The platform is built with a ReactJS frontend, complemented by a scalable backend powered by Google Cloud Firestore and Firebase Realtime Database, ensuring seamless real-time data synchronization and an intuitive user experience.
<br><br>
This project focuses on optimizing learning workflows by integrating an enhanced UI, efficient data management, and dynamic real-time updates. CodeLabz serves as a centralized solution for tutorial creation, consumption, and collaboration, ensuring an effective and scalable educational experience.
<br><br>

**Key Objectives**
1. *Deployment:* 
* Deploy the platform in a production-ready environment with cloud-based hosting(or github pages).
<br><br>

2. *UI/UX Refinement:*
* Refine the UI/UX of the website with proper design principles.
<br><br>

3. *Alternative Backend Strategies:*
* Utilize serverless computing for auto-scaling and cost efficiency.
<br><br>

4. *Containerization & Dockerization:*
* Implement Docker for consistent development and production environments.
<br><br>

5. *CI/CD Integration:*
* Automate testing and deployment using GitHub Actions.
<br><br>

6. *Admin Features:*
* Enhance the admin dashboard with real-time API refresh and analytics..
