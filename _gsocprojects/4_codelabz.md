Brief Explanation
: CodeLabz is an interactive, cloud-based learning platform designed to facilitate engagement with online tutorials. It enables organizations to create, manage, and share structured learning resources with users. The platform is built with a ReactJS frontend, complemented by a scalable backend powered by Google Cloud Firestore and Firebase Realtime Database, ensuring seamless real-time data synchronization and an intuitive user experience.
<br><br>
This project focuses on optimizing learning workflows by integrating an enhanced UI, efficient data management, and dynamic real-time updates. CodeLabz serves as a centralized solution for tutorial creation, consumption, and collaboration, ensuring an effective and scalable educational experience. It currently requires the following improvements.
<br><br>

**Key Objectives**
: 

1. *Backend and Deployment:* 
* The app is temporarily deployed on the client side using Firebase Hosting, so we need a no-cost solution for serverless deployment.
* Find a free serverless hosting solution and migrate APIs from Firebase Functions while ensuring scalability, reliability, and minimal maintenance.
<br>

1. *Implement Real-Time Notification System (No Cost):*
* Research and implement a real-time notification system integrated with in-app notifications.
* Ensure functionality for push and in-app notifications within free-tier limits.
<br>

1. *Managing Org-Setting (Including Roles) and Implement Admin Features:*
* Develop functionalities for managing organization settings.
* Implement role-based access control to ensure secure and controlled access.
* Enhance the admin dashboard with real-time API refresh and analytics.
<br>

1. Optimize NoSQL Queries for Performance:
* Identify key indexes, optimize slow queries, and implement caching or denormalization strategies to improve retrieval times.
<br>

1. *Containerization & Dockerization:*
* Implement Docker for consistent development and production environments.
<br>

1. *UI/UX Refinement:*
* Improve design consistency, usability, and responsiveness across all devices with proper design principles.
* The codebase contains partial migrations and multiple MUI versions, so make it consistent and update it to the latest versions.
<br>

1. *Ensure Proper Migration and Consistency:*
* The codebase includes deprecated npm libraries and modules, update or replace them.
* Convert the existing JavaScript codebase to TypeScript, ensuring type safety and maintainability.
<br><br>

Expected results
: By the completion of this project, CodeLabz will achieve:

* *Optimized API performance:* Faster response times, reduced server load, and enhanced data retrieval, improving overall API performance.
* *Better looking UI/UX:* A visually appealing and responsive interface that works seamlessly across all devices, improving user satisfaction.
* *Scalable real-time backend:* A scalable, serverless backend that handles real-time data synchronization and notifications efficiently.
* *Refined CI/CD pipelines and faster deployment cycles:* Improved data security with role-based access control, ensuring only authorized users access sensitive information.
* *Improved admin functionality:* Advanced analytics, data monitoring, and administrative control tools.
* *Updated and consistent codebase:* Fully migrated, consistent, scalable and maintainable codebase.
