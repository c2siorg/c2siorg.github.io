Brief explanation 
: FactBounty is a crowdsourced fact-checking platform designed to enhance the security, privacy, and trustworthiness of social media ecosystems. With the rise of misinformation, FactBounty leverages the power of intelligent crowds and AI-driven analytics to verify the authenticity of content. The platform features an intuitive user interface, real-time analytics, and seamless integration with various social media channels.
<br><br>
This project focuses on optimizing fact-checking workflows by incorporating AI-powered fake news detection, a refined UI/UX, and scalable backend architecture. FactBounty serves as a centralized solution for fact verification, ensuring a reliable and transparent digital experience.
<br><br>

Key Objectives
: 
 * *UI/UX Design:* Create the appâ€™s user interface and experience by following proper design principles.
 * *AI-Powered Analytics:* Integrate NLP-based analytics to detect and classify fake news efficiently.
 * *React Native Implementation:* Expand the platform by developing a React Native app for cross-platform accessibility.
 * *Backend Migration:* Transition the backend to Go (using Gin or Echo) for improved performance, scalability, and maintainability. Use Go-based async routes. Go provides built-in Swagger support for API documentation.
 * *CI/CD Integration:* Automate testing and deployment using GitHub Actions with docker-conternarizations to ensure seamless updates.
<br><br>

Expected Results
: By the completion of this project, FactBounty will achieve:
 * Overall migration to more efficient frameworks and dependencies in Flask and Elasticsearch.
 * AI-Driven Fact Checking: Improved misinformation detection through NLP-based analytics,semantic similarity matching for detecting duplicate fact-checks.
 * Scalable and Efficient Backend: A Go-based backend for enhanced speed and reliability.
 * Cross-Platform Accessibility: A React Native app ensuring a seamless mobile experience.
 * Automated CI/CD Pipelines: Fully integrated build, test, and deployment workflows with Github actions.
 * Modernize the Frontend: Upgrade React dependencies and remove unnecessary Chrome-only restrictions,consider replacing Redux Devtools dependency if not required.
