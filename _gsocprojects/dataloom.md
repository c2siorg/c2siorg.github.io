Brief explanation
: The goal of this project is to design and implement a web-based GUI for data wrangling, aimed at simplifying the process of managing and transforming tabular datasets. This application will serve as a graphical interface for the powerful Python library, pandas, allowing users to perform complex data manipulation tasks without the need for in-depth programming knowledge. Users will be able to log in, upload their datasets, apply various transformations, and export their results, all through an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
<br><br>

Expected results
: -- A web application that allows users to securely log in and manage their tabular datasets.
<br>
: -- The ability to upload, view, and download datasets in various formats (CSV, Excel, etc.).
<br>
: -- A GUI that provides intuitive access to common data transformation tasks (filtering, sorting, joining, etc.) using pandas functionalities.
<br>
: -- Real-time preview of data transformations to facilitate immediate feedback.
<br>
: -- User-specific workspaces where transformations can be saved and revisited.
Comprehensive documentation on how to use the application, along with examples of common data wrangling tasks.
<br>
: -- A scalable and secure backend architecture using FastAPI to handle requests and perform data transformations.
