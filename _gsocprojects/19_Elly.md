title: Elly - Offline Data Collection & Auto-Sync Feature
---

Brief explanation 
: Currently, App ELLY relies on real-time connectivity for data submission. This project will add offline support, enabling users to collect elephant data in remote locations without internet access. The data will be stored locally and automatically synced with the server once the device is online. This ensures continuous data collection, even in areas with poor network coverage.
<br><br>

Expected Results
: 

* Local data storage on mobile devices (using SQLite or IndexedDB).
* Auto-sync mechanism that uploads data once the internet is available.
* Background sync service to retry failed uploads.
* UI indicators to show pending and successfully uploaded data.
<br><br>

Knowledge Prerequisite
: 
* React Native (for mobile app development)
* Firebase Firestore/SQLite (for local and cloud storage)
* Background services (for auto-sync functionality)
