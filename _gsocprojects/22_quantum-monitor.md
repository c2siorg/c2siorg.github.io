title: QuantumMonitor - Real-Time Quantum Hardware Monitoring Tool
---

Brief explanation 
: QuantumMonitor will be a real-time monitoring tool specifically designed to track the performance and health of quantum hardware. It will collect and visualize critical metrics, including qubit health, noise levels, temperature, and error rates. The tool will provide a comprehensive dashboard that offers insights into quantum processor stability, enabling researchers and engineers to monitor quantum devices more effectively and ensure that they are operating optimally.

Expected Results
: 

* A real-time dashboard displaying vital metrics like qubit coherence, gate fidelity, temperature, and noise levels.
* Alerts for when performance metrics exceed predefined thresholds, signaling potential hardware issues.
* Integration with various quantum hardware providers (IBM Q, Google, Honeywell, etc.) to provide a unified view of hardware performance.
* A historical log of performance data for trend analysis and diagnostic purposes.
* Ability to display health status for individual qubits, including error rates and failures.
<br><br>

Knowledge Prerequisite
: 
* React Native & React.js: To build interactive web and mobile interfaces for the monitoring tool.
* Quantum Hardware APIs: Knowledge of APIs from hardware vendors like IBM Q, Google Quantum AI, or Rigetti to extract real-time metrics.
* Firebase Firestore: For storing historical data and logs of performance metrics.
* Cloud Integration: To enable remote monitoring and store performance data in the cloud for easy access and analysis.
* Data Visualization Tools: Experience with data visualization libraries (e.g., D3.js) for building real-time charts and graphs to display hardware performance.
