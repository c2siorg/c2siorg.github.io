Brief explanation
: WebiU is a dynamic organization website built using reusable component architecture that fetches project data in real time from GitHub repositories, ensuring live updates without manual intervention. It provides configurable templates to showcase project details such as title, description, technology stack, demo links, and organization updates.
<br><br>
The project aims to further improve the platform by optimizing APIs for faster and lighter responses, exploring serverless backend solutions for scalable real-time data handling, integrating CI/CD workflows, and introducing lightweight AI features to enhance project presentation and discoverability without increasing system complexity.
<br><br>

Key Objectives
: 

1. *API Optimization*
* Refactor APIs to reduce response times and payload sizes.
* Implement in-memory caching and compression (e.g., GZIP).
* Explore GraphQL for efficient data fetching.
<br><br>

2. *Alternative Backend Strategies*
* Leverage serverless architectures for scalable real-time data processing.
<br><br>

3. *CI/CD Integration*
* Automate testing, building, and deployment with tools like GitHub Actions.
* Enable safe deployments with rollback and error handling.
<br><br>

4. *Admin Features*
* Extend admin controls with project analytics.
* Provide manual API and AI content refresh options.
<br><br>

5. *AI Enhancements*
* Generate concise project summaries from GitHub README and metadata
* Detect technology stack automatically for accurate tech badges and filtering
* Enable optional natural-language project search mapped to existing metadata
* Cache AI outputs and refresh only on repository updates
<br><br>


Expected Results
: By the end of the summer, WebiU will be production-ready with optimized APIs, a scalable real-time architecture, automated CI/CD workflows, and selective AI enhancements. These improvements will reduce manual effort, improve project discovery, and deliver a cleaner, faster, and more maintainable platform.
