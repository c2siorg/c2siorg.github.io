Brief explanation
: WebiU is a dynamic organization website which uses reusable components concept that fetches project data in real-time from GitHub repositories, ensuring live updates without manual intervention. It provides configurable templates to showcase project details such as title, description, technology stack, and demo links and organisation updates.
<br><br>
WebiU aims to improve the system by optimizing APIs for faster and lighter responses, exploring serverless backend solutions for real-time data handling, and integrating CI/CD workflows to streamline development and deployment.
<br><br>

Key Objectives
: 

1. *API Optimization*
* Refactor APIs to reduce response times and payload sizes.
* Implement in-memory caching and compression (e.g., GZIP).
* Explore modern API solutions like GraphQL for efficient data fetching.
<br><br>

2. *Alternative Backend Strategies*
* Leverage serverless architectures to handle real-time data effectively and scale dynamically.
<br><br>

3. *CI/CD Integration*
* Automate testing, building, and deployment with tools like GitHub Actions.
* Ensure smooth rollback mechanisms and error handling for deployments.
<br><br>

4. *Admin Features*
* Expand admin controls with project analytics and manual API refresh options.
<br><br>


Expected Results
: By the end of the summer, We are planning to make the project live by completing it end-to-end integrations and will deliver faster, lightweight APIs, a robust real-time data architecture, and automated CI/CD workflows. These improvements will enhance user experience, scalability, and developer productivity.
