title: QubitForge - Visual Quantum Circuit Designer
---

Brief explanation:
: QubitForge is a browser-based quantum circuit design and simulation platform inspired by Tinkercad’s intuitive approach to electronics. Users build quantum circuits visually by dragging and dropping qubits, gates, and measurements onto a workspace, then immediately observe simulation results through live visualizations.
<br>
The platform features: 
- Visual Circuit Builder: Drag-and-drop interface for constructing quantum circuits with a component palette 
- Real-time Simulation: Instant state visualization and measurement statistics as circuits are built 
- Component Library: Comprehensive gate library from basic (H, X, Y, Z) to advanced (controlled gates, custom unitaries) 
- Export System: Generate OpenQASM, Qiskit, or PennyLane code from visual circuits
<br>
The UI mimics Tinkercad’s workspace, central canvas, left component palette, and right properties/output panel.
<br><br>

Expected results
: * Circuit Workspace: Grid-based canvas with zoom, pan, and undo/redo support.
* Gate Palette: Categorized component library with drag-and-drop functionality.
* Wire System: Visual qubit wires connecting gates with automatic routing.
* Simulation Panel: State vector display, probability bars, and measurement histogram.
* Export Module: Code generation for OpenQASM 2.0/3.0, Qiskit, and PennyLane formats.
* Circuit Library: Save/load circuits, shareable circuit links.
<br><br>

Knowledge Prerequisite
: * Frontend Development: ReactJS, React DnD or similar drag-drop library, Canvas/SVG graphics.
* Quantum Computing: Understanding of quantum gates, circuits, and measurements.
* Visualization: Chart libraries for simulation output display.
* State Management: Complex state handling for circuit representation
