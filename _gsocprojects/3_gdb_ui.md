title: GDB UI
---

Brief explanation 
: GDB-UI is a modern, web-based interface for the GNU Debugger (GDB), designed to simplify the debugging process for developers working with C, and C++. It provides real-time interaction with GDB, enabling features like monitoring program execution, inspecting variables, setting breakpoints, and more, all through an intuitive web application.
<br><br>
GDB-UI enhances the debugging workflow by offering a sleek, user-friendly UI, replacing the traditional command-line experience with a visual and accessible alternative. It supports both Docker-based and manual setups, allowing seamless integration into various development environments.
<br><br>

**Key Objectives**
1. *First Deployment:* 
* Deploy the project for initial use, ensuring the application is accessible and functional for all users.
<br><br>

2. *CI/CD Integration:*
* Automate the testing, building, and deployment processes using tools like GitHub Actions.
* Ensure smooth deployment pipelines with robust rollback mechanisms and proper error handling.
<br><br>

3. *Session Management for Multiuser Support:*
* Implement a system to store debugging sessions uniquely for each user to enable multiuser functionality.
* Ensure session persistence and isolation to prevent interference between users.
<br><br>

4. *Real-Time Debugging Results:*
* Design the application to display debugger results in real time without requiring page refreshes.
* Use WebSockets or similar technologies to handle live updates efficiently.
<br><br>


Expected Results
: By the completion of the project, the application will be fully deployed with multiuser support, persistent session management, real-time debugging results, and a robust CI/CD pipeline. These enhancements will provide a seamless debugging experience, improve scalability, and simplify the development workflow for contributors.
