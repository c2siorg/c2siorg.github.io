title: QuantumCanvas - Interactive Quantum Education Platform
---

Brief explanation:
: QuantumCanvas is an interactive educational platform that teaches quantum computing through intuition-first, hands-on learning. Unlike traditional quantum education that relies heavily on mathematics, QuantumCanvas uses visual simulations and interactive experiments to build understanding.
<br>
The platform features: 
- Interactive Quantum Foundations: Visual exploration of qubits, superposition, measurement, and interference through manipulable simulations.
- Progressive Learning Paths: Structured curriculum starting from basic concepts to advanced topics like Quantum Machine Learning.
- Experiment Builder: Hands-on workspace where learners manipulate quantum states and observe outcomes in real-time. 
- Export Capabilities: Convert interactive experiments to OpenQASM for use with real quantum frameworks.
<br>
The UI follows Google Codelabs design patterns, clean, step-by-step tutorials with embedded interactive components.

Expected results
: * Learning Module System: Branching curriculum with foundational quantum concepts and specialized tracks (QML as first branch).
* Interactive Simulation Components: Bloch sphere visualizer, state vector displays, probability distribution charts, and gate effect animations.
* Experiment Workspace: Drag-and-drop interface for building simple quantum experiments with live feedback.
* OpenQASM Export: Convert user experiments to standard quantum circuit representations.
* Progress Tracking: Track learner progress through modules and experiments.
<br><br>

Knowledge Prerequisite
: * Frontend Development: ReactJS, state management (Redux/Zustand), component libraries.
* Quantum Computing Basics: Understanding of qubits, gates, and measurement (will deepen during project).
* Visualization: D3.js or Three.js for interactive quantum state visualizations.
* Web APIs: REST API design for progress tracking and content delivery.
