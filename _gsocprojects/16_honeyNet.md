Brief explanation 
: Develop a scalable, cloud-native honeypot deployment framework that leverages Terraform to provision and manage honeypot instances across multiple geographic regions. This platform will help security teams gather threat intelligence, understand attacker methodologies, and improve defensive postures by simulating realistic targets in various cloud environments.
<br><br>

Expected Results
: Check project GeoDNSScanner (<https://github.com/c2siorg/GeoDnsScanner>), you will create something similar to this but to deploy honeypots
<br><br>

Key Objectives
: 
* *Automated Deployment:* Use Terraform to automate the provisioning, configuration, and decommissioning of honeypot infrastructure across multiple regions and potentially multiple cloud providers.
* *Distributed Architecture:* Deploy honeypots in various regions (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific) to capture a diverse range of attack vectors and adapt to region-specific threat landscapes.
* *Data Enrichment:* Integrate logging, monitoring, and analytics to enrich raw data, correlating attack patterns with global threat intelligence feeds.
* *Scalability and Flexibility:* Implement modular Terraform configurations and cloud-native services to enable rapid scaling, dynamic resource allocation, and easy modifications.
