title: ImageLab - Improve user experience
---

Brief explanation 
: ImageLab is a standalone tool designed to help users learn and experiment with image processing techniques interactively. It provides an intuitive environment for beginners to understand image processing concepts without deep programming knowledge. Advanced users can use ImageLab as a test environment before implementing actual image processing applications.
<br><br>

Expected Results
: The goal of this year is to improve the ImageLab experience for the users and the developers alike.
