title: Skam Shield - AI-Free Real-Time Scam Detector
---

Brief explanation 
: Skam Shield currently offers scam protection through manual reporting and browser extensions. This project aims to build a real-time scam detection system for Windows, macOS, and Android that runs in the background and automatically detects and blocks scam attempts without using AI. The system will rely on rule-based detection, regex filtering, and user behavior tracking to identify fraudulent activities such as tech support scams, fake pop ups, phishing attempts, and scam calls.
<br><br>

Expected Results
: 

* Windows/macOS background service that detects and blocks scam popups, VoIP calls, and phishing links.
* Android app that blocks scam calls & SMS and prevents fraudulent transactions.
* Browser integration for detecting phishing URLs and scam warnings.
* Auto-updating scam blacklist (integrated with Skam Shield Firestore DB).
* Detailed scam attempt logs for forensic analysis.
<br><br>

Knowledge Prerequisite
: 
* JavaScript (for browser extension)
* Python or C++ (for system-level monitoring)
* Firebase Firestore (for managing scam blacklists)
* Android/Kotlin/ React Native (for mobile call and SMS blocking)
