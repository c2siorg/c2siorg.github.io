title: Data storing and querying engine for Hyperledger Fabric  
---

Brief explanation 
: This project aims to develop a data storing and querying engine for Hyperledger Fabric that leverages the SmartQC transaction model proposed in the paper [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17868). The goal is to enable efficient storage and retrieval of complex data transactions while ensuring immutability, auditability, and efficient query execution on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). This system will enable users to perform complex queries on the ledger with minimum complexity.
<br><br>

Expected Results
: 
 * Implementation of the transaction model validator node in GoLang
 * An architecture for the querying engine that facilitates faster and more complex queries (using an : Off-chain DB that keeps a ledger copy or indexing mechanism before putting it into the ledger)
 * Performance analysis
<br><br>

Knowledge Prerequisite
: Go Programming Language, Docker, Blockchain & Distributed Ledger, Hyperledger Fabric, SmartQC Transaction Model
