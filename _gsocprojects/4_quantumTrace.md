title: QuantumTrace - Visual Quantum Circuit Debugger
---

Brief explanation:
: QuantumTrace is a visual debugging and tracing platform for quantum circuits that reveals how quantum states evolve during computation. Unlike traditional quantum tools that only show final measurement results, QuantumTrace provides step-by-step visualization of quantum state changes throughout circuit execution.
<br>
The platform features: 
- Step-Through Execution: Pause at any point in a circuit to inspect the quantum state.
- State Visualization: View probability distributions, Bloch sphere representations, and entanglement indicators at each step. 
- Interference Tracking: Observe how quantum interference builds up across gates. 
- Breakpoints: Set conditions to pause execution when specific state conditions are met. 
- Circuit Import: Load circuits from OpenQASM or integrate with circuit builders.
<br>
The UI draws inspiration from Chrome DevTools and VS Code Debugger, a timeline-based execution view, state inspection panel, and breakpoint controls.

Expected results
: * Debugger Interface: Timeline scrubber, step/run controls, breakpoint markers.
* State Inspector Panel: Detailed view of current quantum state (amplitudes, phases, probabilities).
* Visualization Components: Bloch sphere, probability bars, state vector table, correlation matrix.
* Breakpoint System: Pause on amplitude thresholds, entanglement detection, or specific states.
* Circuit Import: Parse OpenQASM and visualize any quantum circuit.
* Execution History: View and compare states at different execution points

* Quantum Computing: Deep understanding of quantum state evolution, gates, and measurement.
* Visualization: D3.js or Three.js for state visualizations, timeline components.
