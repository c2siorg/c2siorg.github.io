title: Distributed Quantum Computing Across Multiple QPUs
---

Brief explanation 
: This project aims to explore and implement distributed quantum computing by leveraging multiple Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) across various hardware platforms. By integrating quantum circuits across IBM Quantum, Amazon Braket, Azure Quantum, and other quantum devices, the goal is to enhance the scalability and efficiency of quantum algorithms. The project will focus on coordinating the execution of quantum tasks on different QPUs, addressing the limitations of cross-hardware compatibility and entanglement, and developing methods for seamless integration of these diverse quantum systems into a unified architecture.

Expected Results
: 

* Successful distribution of quantum circuits across multiple QPUs from different vendors (e.g., IBM, Rigetti, IonQ).
* Creation of a hybrid quantum-classical orchestration system for resource management and job scheduling.
* Execution of a quantum algorithm that spans multiple quantum devices and provides insights into how to improve quantum communication between these devices.
* Evaluation of the latency, performance, and error rates of distributed quantum executions compared to single-device operations.
