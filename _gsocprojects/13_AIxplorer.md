title: AIXPlorer AI Powered Blockchain Explorer
---

Brief explanation 
: AIXPlorer is an open-source, AI-powered blockchain explorer designed to provide transaction, address, and other blockchain data in an intuitive, human-centric manner. Our goal is to enhance accessibility and usability by leveraging AI to present complex blockchain information in a more digestible format.
<br><br>

Expected Results
: This project is in its early stages, and we are focused on making it more robust and feature-complete. Key areas of improvement include:
<br><br>
* Expanding support for multiple blockchain networks, including Solana, Sui, and Aptos.
* Enhancing our existing AI capabilities, currently utilizing Vercel AI SDK, while exploring alternative lightweight agent frameworks or developing our own.
* Avoiding reliance on third-party APIs by building custom transaction parsers, data decoders, and indexing mechanisms.
* Creating APIs to enable seamless integration of our AI-powered agent for external use.
<br><br>

Key Objectives
: 
* *Codebase Optimization*: Refactor and improve the existing codebase for better maintainability and performance.
* *Advanced Event Decoding & Indexing*: Improve transaction parsing, event decoding, and indexing mechanisms.
* *Multi-Chain Support*: Integrate support for Solana, Sui, and Aptos blockchains.
* *Enhanced UI/UX*: Design an improved, visually appealing UI that aligns with conventional blockchain explorers.
* *Optimized AI Integration*: Research and integrate the best AI agent frameworks for efficient data processing.
* *Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Implementation*: Incorporate RAG to reduce large language model (LLM) processing costs and improve response accuracy.
* *API Development*: Build APIs to allow external developers to easily integrate and use the AI-powered agent.
<br><br>

Scope & Implementation Plan
: Not all features need to be implemented within this year's GSoC timeline. Instead, participants should propose a structured plan outlining:
* Feasible milestones and deliverables within the GSoC period.
* The approach for integrating AI-driven enhancements.
* Strategies for optimizing indexing, event decoding, and multi-chain support.
* Research and justification for the best AI agent framework to use.
* API design and implementation strategy for seamless agent integration.
