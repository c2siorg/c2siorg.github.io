title: WebGPU - New feature for the WebGPU framework
---

Brief explanation 
: WebGPU is a novel framework for Federated Learning (FL) that supports machine learning model training over web browsers. The idea is to develop a comprehensive framework around web browsers with the support of the WebGPU access via the web browser. Users can deploy the server in a single machine and connect clients via browser using server url and strat the federated learning process on the client side. The server should  handle the management process of the FL network.
<br><br>
Current implementation on WebGPU does not support advanced features such as differential privacy, personalization, client selection algorithms and asynchronization on FL etc. This project aims to fix the current implementation to support at least above 3 implementations + asynchronization.
<br><br>

Expected Results
: At the end of your summer, we expect that you will complete at least the mentioned 3 implementations along with the issues on the current implementation. This includes but is not limited to fixing broken features, enhancing the UI on the browser and performance improvement on the server implementation and the client implementation. Also, you have to improve the wikis which are related to your development areas. Come up with a plan of what features you are gonna do when as a timeline. Consider improving the wikis also in your timeline.
<br><br>

Knowledge Prerequisite
: The implementation requires basic understanding of Python and React(JavaScrip) and deep knowledge on machine learning along with federated learning.
