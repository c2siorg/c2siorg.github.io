title: GDB UI
---

Brief explanation 
: GDB, the GNU Debugger, is a versatile and widely used debugger for several programming languages such as C, C++, and Ada. It enables developers to see what is happening inside a program as it runs, which is invaluable for debugging and fixing code issues. GDB boasts a variety of features, including the ability to start and stop program execution, examine the state of the program (variables, registers, memory, etc.), among others.
<br><br>
Although GDB operates within a terminal, this project's mission is to develop a user interface (UI) utilizing React. This UI will specifically interact with the GDB Python API, creating a dashboard that eases the use of GDB's features through a graphical interface. This initiative strives to provide a more intuitive and accessible way for developers to execute commands and control operations using the GDB Python API.
<br><br>

Knowledge Prerequisites
: -- Proficiency in React and modern web development practices.
: -- Familiarity with the Python programming language and creating Python bindings or interfaces.
: -- Basic understanding of debugging concepts and experience with GDB or similar debugging tools.
: -- Knowledge of software development principles and version control (e.g., Git).
<br><br>

Expected Results
: -- By the end of the project, the following outcomes are anticipated:
: -- A fully functional React-based UI for GDB that allows users to perform debugging tasks graphically.
: -- Integration with the GDB Python API for executing commands and retrieving program states.
: -- User-friendly documentation on how to set up, use, and extend the UI.
: -- A set of features including, but not limited to, starting/stopping program execution, inspecting variables, registers, and memory, and a log or console view for command output and error messages.
: -- Contribution guidelines for the open-source community to further enhance and develop the UI.
