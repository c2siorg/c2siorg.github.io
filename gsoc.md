## Important Guidelines on Submitting Ideas

*There are some important guidelines to submit ideas, please read these carefully before adding your ideas!*

1. There is a fixed time period for implementing and coding your ideas.
2. Come up with attainable goals and you will be able to complete what you set out to do. You can always contact our mentors and community and get an idea about the workload and whether you might be able to complete them.
3. You are free to come up with your own ideas. The ideas should be about Internet of Things (IOT), Computer Security and Software Tools. Also if you love to work on any of these subjects but do not have an idea you can always contact us.
4. Lets Talk! The best way to solve problems that you might have is to contact our mentors and also our community.
5. We encourage you to do documentation so that we can keep track of your progress and also help you if things are not going according to plan. Although not compulsory we have a strong belief that this method can cut down your time to code and also the workload of the mentors drastically.
6. Please send your new project ideas to gsoc[at]c2si.com
